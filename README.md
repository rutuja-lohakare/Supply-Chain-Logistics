# Supply Chain Logistics Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a Supply Chain Logistics dataset, focusing on key business questions and predictive modeling. The project aims to enhance decision-making in supply chain management by employing machine learning techniques and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Key Business Questions Addressed
1. **Can Plants Handle the Daily Order Demand?**
   - Analysis of plant capacities versus daily order data to assess efficiency and capacity planning.

2. **Carriers and Routes with Most Delays and Throughput Times**
   - Investigation of shipment delays across carriers and routes, and their variance across service levels (DTD, DTP, CRF).

3. **Shipping Volume Distribution**
   - Exploration of weight distribution per route, high volume service levels, and top-selling products per route for effective inventory management.

4. **Most Cost-Effective Carrier Transportation Options**
   - Analysis to determine cost-effective carriers and modes of transport, focusing on air and ground options.

5. **Top Customers by Order Count**
   - Identification of customers with the highest number of orders for targeted marketing and relationship management.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring data quality and integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual and statistical examination of data to uncover initial insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing models to answer business questions, using techniques like linear regression and KMeans clustering.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy and precision to validate findings.

## Conclusion
The project provides comprehensive insights into supply chain logistics, highlighting areas for operational optimization and decision-making. It underscores the importance of data-driven strategies in managing supply chain complexities.
